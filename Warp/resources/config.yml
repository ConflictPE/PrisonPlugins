display-exact-coordinates: false

  # SimpleWarp can handle the storage of warps in three main ways.
  #
  # MEMORY_TILL_CLOSE = 0
  # Warps are loaded into memory when the server starts and are
  # held there until the server closes. When the server closes
  # they are converted back into YAML. This new YAML will
  # replace warps.yml, this means that changes are lost and
  # warps which fail to load are discarded.
  #
  #
  # FLUSH_ON_CHANGE = 1
  # Warps are loaded into memory when the server starts. Whenever a
  # warp is updated, it will be updated in the warps.yml. When the
  # server closes, the warps file is NOT overwritten.
  #
  # NO_MEMORY_STORE = 2
  # Warps are never "stored" in memory. They are converted on demand
  # between YAML and object format. Any changes made to the config
  # will be available right away in the server and vice versa.
  #
essentials-support: false
  # If essentials-support is enabled and EssentialsPE is installed,
  # SimpleWarp will take steps to ensure compatibility between the
  # two plugins.
